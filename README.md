# Project Title: IPL Score Predictor

**Project Introduction:** The IPL Score Predictor project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the total score of ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches in real-time. 

# Project Details

**Input Data:** The application will take various statistics and details of the current IPL match as input to make predictions. These inputs include:

** - Batting Team:** Selection of the team currently at bat.
** - Bowling Team:** Selection of the opposing bowling team.
** - Current Over:** The over currently in progress.
** - Current Runs:** The number of runs scored up to the current over.
** - Wickets Taken:** The number of wickets fallen up to the current over.
** - Runs in Last 5 Overs:** Runs scored in the last 5 overs.
** - Wickets in Last 5 Overs:** Wickets taken in the last 5 overs.
   
**Machine Learning Model:** We will develop and train a machine learning model using historical IPL match data. This model will learn to  analyze the provided inputs and predict the total score a team is likely to achieve by the end of the innings.
